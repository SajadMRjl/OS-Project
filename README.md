# OS-Project

An educational, Unix-like operating system written in C and x86 Assembly. This project is designed to explore the core concepts of operating systems including process management, file systems, memory, and system calls. Itâ€™s inspired by MIT's xv6 and developed for learning and experimentation.


## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project simulates a basic OS kernel with a command-line interface (shell), multitasking capabilities, file system support, and user-space programs. It runs on emulators like QEMU and Bochs and is ideal for operating systems coursework or self-study.


## âœ¨ Features

- Custom bootloader and kernel entry in assembly
- Process creation, scheduling, and termination
- Shell interface with built-in utilities (`ls`, `cat`, `echo`, `grep`, etc.)
- System call interface for user/kernel communication
- Simple file system with directories, inodes, and disk block management
- Virtual memory and paging (basic)
- Device drivers: keyboard, disk (IDE), serial port (UART)
- Multiprocess testing (`forktest`, `stressfs`, `usertests`)
